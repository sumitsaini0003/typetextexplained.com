<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In a p-type semiconductor, the hole density is much greater than the electron density. The acceptor energy level of the p-type is close to the valency bond and away from the conduction band. In an n-type semiconductor an intrinsic semiconductor doped with phosphorus or antimony as impurity.</p>

    <h2>N-type Semicondutor</h2>
    <p>An N-type semiconductor is a type of material used in electronics.

        It is made by adding an impurity to a pure semiconductor such as silicon or germanium. The impurities used may be phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth or some other chemical element. They are called donor impurities. The impurity is called a donor because it gives a free electron to a semiconductor. The purpose of doing this is to make more charge carriers, or electron wires available in the material for conduction. The final material is a lot more conductive than the original silicon or germanium.</p>

<h2>P-Type Semiconductors</h2>
<p>In a pure (intrinsic) Si or Ge semiconductor, each nucleus uses its four valence electrons to form four covalent bonds with its neighbors (see figure below). Each ionic core, consisting of the nucleus and non-valent electrons, has a net charge of +4, and is surrounded by 4 valence electrons. Since there are no excess electrons or holes In this case, the number of electrons and holes present at any given time will always be equal.
    p-n junction diodes are made up of two adjacent pieces of p-type and n-type semiconducting materials. p-type and n-type materials are simply semiconductors, such as silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge), with atomic impurities; the type of impurity present determines the type of the semiconductor. The process of purposefully adding impurities to materials is called doping; semiconductors with impurities are referred to as "doped semiconductors".

<h2>Comparison</h2>
<p>The major difference between N-type & P-type semiconductors is that the N-type semiconductor has free electrons as a majority of charge carriers & holes are in the minority. On the other hand, the P-type semiconductor has holes as a majority of charge carriers & electrons are in the minority.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, this article highlights the most prominent differences between the two kinds of extrinsic semiconductors namely: N-type and P-type semiconductors. The major difference between them is that the n-type semiconductors are doped with pentavalent donor impurity atoms, having one extra electron available in its valence band, thus enabling the release of abundant free electrons, and resulting in increased conductivity. On the other hand, p-type semiconductors are doped with trivalent acceptor impurity atoms, that are deficient in one electron, resulting in the abundant generation of holes, leading to increased conductivity, which can further be increased with the rise in temperature.</p>
